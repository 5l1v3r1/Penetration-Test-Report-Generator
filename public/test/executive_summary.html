	<h1><a name="exec_sum">Executive Summary</a></h1>
	<p>At the request of SampleNET, the ACS Penetration testing team performed the security assessment of   
	the externally facing network infrastructure. The purpose of this assessment was to identify network and 
	application-level security issues.</p>

	<p>The objective of the analysis is to simulate an attack to assess SampleNET's immunity level, discover 
	weak links and provide recommendations and guidelines to vulnerable entities discovered. This report is a report 
	which contains sub-sections. Each Sub-section discusses in detail all relevant issues and avenues that can be 
	used by attackers to compromise and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>

	<p>Every issue includes an overview of issues found and security guidelines, which, if followed correctly, will 
	ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the systems and applications.</p>

	<p>ACS's assessment methodology includes structured review processes based on recognized “best-in-class” practices 
	as defined by such methodologies as the ISECOM's Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), the Open 
	Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and ISO 27001 Information Security Standard.</p>

	<p>Phase One (Footprinting and Enumeration) of the test was executed within ACS's Penetration testing Lab facility 
	while phase two (Scanning, and Exploitation) was conducted again from the ACS's Penetration testing Lab facility.</p>

	<p>This testing did not explicitly attempt Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against any of the SampleNET systems. 
	However, we performed the security assessment of the external network and web application as an unauthorized user. 
	Login credentials to the web applications systems were not obtained as part of the testing process. This was a 
	complete blind test simulating a typical external hacker's view of the organization.</p>

	<h1><a name="proj_obj">Project Objectives</a></h1>
	<p>The objective of the SampleNET assessment is to determine the overall security of the network and applications 
	by analyzing all exposed services and web applications for various vulnerabilities.</p>

	<h1><a name="proj_scope">Project Scope</a></h1>
	<p>The assessment performed was focused on SampleNET' external network infrastructure as well as its related 
	systems. The specific systems and subnets tested are indicated in the next section titled “Target Systems.”</p>

	<p>This result is intended to be an overall assessment of SampleNET' external network, and those systems that 
	fall within the scope of this project. Furthermore, the findings in this report reflect the conditions found during 
	the testing, and do not necessarily reflect current conditions.</p>

	<p>This testing did not attempt any active network-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Social engineering attacks 
	were also outside our remit.</p>
